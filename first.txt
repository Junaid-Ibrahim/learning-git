so this is the first commit being made to the main branch
lets see what happens

this is an extra feature
so i think this is on both main and feature branch

so no problem when i get rid of stuff in the new branch nor when i add, as long as the original branch was untouched
i think a minimum of 3 commits are required for representing the merged branch in ascii
